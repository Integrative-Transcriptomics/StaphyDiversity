# A landscape of metallophore synthesis and uptake potential of the genus Staphylococcus
## Figures computation

We provide the code used to produce the figures 2 and 6, as well as their input. The input can be also reproduced based on the scripts found in the scripts/ folder

- Figure2: Overview of all analyses computed for the species representatives. The figure had to be modified in Inkscape to avoid overlaps of the heatmaps as well as to add the asterisk of the figure in the manuscript.
- Figure6: Overview of the results at the strain level analysis. Each UpSet plot had to be modified to merge lines with completeness and incomplete, as the R-library does not provide such a visualization option.
